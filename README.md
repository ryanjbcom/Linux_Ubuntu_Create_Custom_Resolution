Linux, Ubuntu 15.10 (maybe all versions), script &amp; instructions to set custom screen resolution

I tried this on an old Dell XPS m1330 laptop.
The pc is configured for Ubuntu 15.10 64bit
Max native resolution is 1280x800
With and NVIDIA 8400GS video card.

My Ubuntu system was setup to use the x driver; the methods here will not work with the NVIDIA drivers.

xrandr !!!!
